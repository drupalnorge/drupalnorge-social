# This config.yaml was created with ddev version v0.20.0 
# webimage: drud/nginx-php-fpm-local:v0.20.0
# dbimage: drud/mariadb-local:v0.20.0
# dbaimage: drud/phpmyadmin:v0.20.0
# However we do not recommend explicitly wiring these images into the
# config.yaml as they may break future versions of ddev.
# You can update this config.yaml using 'ddev config'.

# Key features of ddev's config.yaml:

# name: <projectname> # Name of the project, automatically provides 
#   http://projectname.ddev.local and https://projectname.ddev.local

# type: <projecttype>  # drupal6/7/8, backdrop, typo3, wordpress, php

# docroot: <relative_path> # Relative path to the directory containing index.php.

# php_version: "7.1"  # PHP version to use, "5.6", "7.0", "7.1", "7.2"

# You can explicitly specify the webimage, dbimage, dbaimage lines but this 
# is not recommended, as the images are often closely tied to ddev's' behavior,
# so this can break upgrades.

# webimage: <docker_image>  # nginx/php docker image. 
# dbimage: <docker_image>  # mariadb docker image. 
# dbaimage: <docker_image>

# router_http_port: <port>  # Port to be used for http (defaults to port 80)
# router_https_port: <port> # Port for https (defaults to 443)

# xdebug_enabled: false  # Set to true to enable xdebug and "ddev start" or "ddev restart"

#additional_hostnames:
# - somename
# - someothername
# would provide http and https URLs for "somename.ddev.local"
# and "someothername.ddev.local".

# provider: default # Currently either "default" or "pantheon"
#
# Many ddev commands can be extended to run tasks after the ddev command is
# executed.
# See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extending-commands/ for more
# information on the commands that can be extended and the tasks you can define
# for them. Example:
#hooks:
# post-import-db:
#   - exec: drush cr
#   - exec: drush updb

hooks:
  post-start:
    - exec: "composer install -d /var/www/html"
